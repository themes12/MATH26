# MATH26
MATH26 is a questions and answers game. This application was made by Vue.js and designed for <b>Phonegap</b>, 
I don't know if it can run using Cordova or not, so you can try it yourself. But it also works very well in a browser so <b>you can deploy it on website.</b>
# Example
This application was developed using the Thai language, but it's just simple words, so you can translate it using google.<br>
<b>The video is not smooth because my phone is bad.</b><br>

# How to use it?
As you can see in the video, you need to answer the math question to complete the word, and the database has 3 .json files, just edit these 3 files and check it out.
